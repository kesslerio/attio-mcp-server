# Fix for get-list-details Tool (Issue #179)

## Issue Summary

The `get-list-details` tool was failing when used through the MCP server. It returned an API error instead of the expected list details due to a missing tool type handler in the dispatcher.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. The MCP tool named `get-list-details` has its handler and definition properly set up in `src/handlers/tool-configs/lists.ts`.
2. The function `getListDetails` in `src/objects/lists.ts` that actually retrieves the list details works correctly.
3. However, the dispatcher code in `src/handlers/tools/dispatcher.ts` was missing specific handling for the `getListDetails` tool type.
4. Additionally, the tool configuration did not include a `formatResult` function to format the Attio API response into a readable format.

## Fix Implementation

1. Added a dedicated tool type handler in `src/handlers/tools/dispatcher.ts` for the `getListDetails` tool type:
   - Implemented proper argument validation for the required `listId` parameter
   - Added proper error handling and formatted error responses
   - Invoked the handler with the correct parameters
   - Used the `formatResult` function from the tool config if present

2. Added a `formatResult` function to the `getListDetails` tool configuration in `src/handlers/tool-configs/lists.ts`:
   - Properly extracts the list ID, name, and other details
   - Formats the response into a readable format with list details
   - Handles potential missing fields gracefully

## Testing

1. Created a test script to verify the fix:
   - `scripts/test-get-list-details.js` to test the MCP tool invocation directly
   - Confirmed that the tool now returns formatted list details instead of an error
   - Verified that missing or invalid `listId` parameters are handled appropriately

## Conclusion

The fix ensures the `get-list-details` tool works correctly through the MCP server. It now returns properly formatted list details when provided with a valid list ID, and returns appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-04

This is a major release featuring the Universal Tool Consolidation, which dramatically simplifies the MCP interface by replacing 50+ resource-specific tools with a unified set of universal tools that work across all resource types.

### Added

#### Universal Tool System (#352, #358)

- **Universal Tools**: New consolidated tools that work across all resource types (companies, people, deals, tasks, records)
  - `search-records`: Search any resource type with consistent interface
  - `get-record-details`: Get details for any record type
  - `create-record`: Create records of any type
  - `update-record`: Update records of any type
  - `delete-record`: Delete records of any type
  - `discover-attributes`: Discover attributes for any resource type
  - `get-detailed-info`: Get categorized information (basic, contact, business, social)
- **Advanced Operations**: New tools for complex operations
  - `advanced-search`: Multi-attribute search with complex filters
  - `search-by-relationship`: Find records by their relationships
  - `search-by-content`: Search by notes or interaction content
  - `search-by-timeframe`: Search by creation/update dates
  - `batch-operations`: Perform bulk operations efficiently
- **Resource Type Support**: Full support for companies, people, deals, tasks, and generic records
- **Backwards Compatibility**: All existing tool names continue to work via intelligent routing

#### Enhanced Error Handling System (#362)

- Comprehensive error categorization (USER_ERROR, SYSTEM_ERROR, API_ERROR)
- Detailed error messages with examples and suggestions
- Field-specific guidance for common mistakes
- HTTP status code mapping for better API integration
- Structured error responses with actionable feedback

#### Deal Management Improvements

- Comprehensive deal field error messages for common mistakes (description, probability, source, close_date, tags, etc.)
- Deal field documentation showing available vs non-existent fields
- Currency handling guidance - Attio automatically formats currency based on workspace settings
- Field name conversions for backwards compatibility:
  - `company_id` → `associated_company`
  - `deal_stage` → `stage`
  - `deal_value` → `value`
  - `deal_name` → `name`

#### Documentation & Testing (#360, #359)

- Complete universal tools documentation with examples
- Comprehensive integration test suite for all universal operations
- Performance benchmarks for batch operations
- Migration guide from resource-specific to universal tools

#### Developer Experience

- Config migration tool for postal code mapping fix (#330)
- Enhanced validation pipeline with mandatory pre-commit checks
- Systematic lint reduction plan (targeting <100 warnings from ~800)
- Improved environment setup for API integration testing

### Changed

#### API & Tool Behavior

- **Simplified Currency Handling**: Deal values now accept plain numbers (e.g., `value: 9780`) instead of complex objects
- **Consistent Search Interface**: All search operations now use the same filter structure
- **Unified Response Format**: All tools return consistent response structures
- **Better Field Validation**: Proactive validation with helpful suggestions before API calls
- **Improved Error Messages**: Context-aware error messages that guide users to solutions

#### Infrastructure & Performance

- Consolidated 50+ individual tool handlers into modular universal handlers
- Reduced code duplication by ~70% through shared implementations
- Improved response times through optimized routing
- Better memory usage with streamlined tool definitions
- Enhanced TypeScript type safety throughout the codebase

2. Consider migrating to universal tools for new implementations
3. Deal currency values should now be simple numbers
4. Use `associated_company` instead of `company_id` for deals

## Analysis for Batch Operations Implementation

I've conducted a detailed analysis of what's needed to implement batch operations for the Attio API. Here's a summary:

### Current State
- The codebase has a solid foundation with strong typing, error handling, and retry logic
- Operations are currently performed one-at-a-time, resulting in higher latency and more API calls
- The existing retry mechanism can be leveraged for batch operations

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Create Core Batch Framework**:
   - Generic interfaces for batch requests and responses
   - Batch execution function with configurable behavior
   - Support for partial failures with detailed reporting

2. **Add Resource-Specific Implementations**:
   - Type-safe batch operations for People, Companies, and Lists
   - Consistent interface design across all resource types
   - Maintain compatibility with existing single-item operations

3. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Track success/failure for each item in a batch
   - Provide detailed error information for troubleshooting
   - Support continuing on partial failures (configurable)

4. **Implementation Phases**:
   - Phase 1: Core batch framework
   - Phase 2: Resource-specific implementations
   - Phase 3: Testing and refinement
   - Phase 4: Documentation

### Key Benefits
- **Performance**: Significant reduction in API calls
- **Reliability**: Enhanced error handling with partial success capability
- **User Experience**: Faster response times for bulk operations

### Challenges and Mitigations
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement configurable delays between batches
- **Response Format Consistency**: Normalize responses in batch executor
- **Error Context**: Maintain operation context throughout the process

This implementation will leverage our existing code structure while adding powerful batch capabilities that optimize API usage and improve performance.

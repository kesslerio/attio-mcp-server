I need to check each list to see if Integrative Pain Specialists is a member. However, it appears there's an issue with the list IDs in the system, as they're showing up as "[object Object]" instead of actual ID strings.

Let me try another approach by searching for people associated with Integrative Pain Specialists, which might give us more information:

Based on the information I was able to retrieve, I found that:

Integrative Pain Specialists exists in the Attio system with ID 128193fa-b9d5-4485-b5e0-5cef3e8129be
I wasn't able to definitively determine which lists it belongs to due to a technical issue with the list IDs
There are no people in the system directly associated with the company name in the search
Would you like me to try a different approach to find this information? Perhaps if you know of any specific lists you're interested in, we could check those individually.

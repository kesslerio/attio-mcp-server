# Company Tools Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring improves the company operation handlers in the `dispatcher.ts` file by extracting common patterns into helper functions, enhancing validation, adding better logging, and improving error handling.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Helper Functions

Created three consistent handler functions for company operations:

- `handleCompanyBatchOperation`: Manages batch operations for companies (create/update)
- `handleCompanyOperation`: Manages individual company operations (create/update)
- `handleCompanyAttributeUpdate`: Manages company attribute updates

### 2. Enhanced Validation

- Added `validateAttributes` function for consistent attribute validation
- Improved parameter validation across all handlers
- Added proper null value handling for attribute updates
- Enhanced error messages with more context

### 3. Better Logging

- Added `logToolRequest` for consistent request logging in development mode
- Added `logToolError` for detailed error logging with context
- Enhanced debugging information for troubleshooting

### 4. Error Handling

- Improved error response formatting with more context
- Added detailed error information for API interactions
- Enhanced error messaging for parameter validation failures

## Specific Handler Improvements

### Batch Operations

- Fixed handling of `objectSlug` to always use "companies" resource type
- Improved validation of the records/updates array
- Enhanced formatting of batch operation results

### Individual Operations

- Fixed handling of `companyId` parameter
- Improved attribute validation
- Enhanced success/failure messaging

### Attribute Updates

- Added special handling for null values (attribute clearing)
- Improved attribute name validation
- Enhanced response formatting

## Testing

Manual test files have been added to verify the refactored code:

- `test-refactored-attribute-update.js`
- `test-refactored-batch-update.js`

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive automated tests for the refactored helper functions
2. Consider similar refactoring for people-related operations
3. Update documentation to reflect the improved error handling and validation

## Benefits

- **Code Reusability**: Common patterns extracted into reusable functions
- **Consistency**: Unified approach to parameter validation and error handling
- **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain with clear separation of concerns
- **Debuggability**: Enhanced logging for better troubleshooting
- **Robustness**: Improved validation prevents runtime errors

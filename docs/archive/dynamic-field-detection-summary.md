# Dynamic Field Detection System Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive dynamic field detection system for the Attio MCP Server that automatically detects and formats field values based on their Attio type. This system eliminates the need for hardcoded field mappings and allows the MCP server to work with any custom attributes that organizations might have in their Attio workspace.

## Key Features

### 1. Automatic Field Type Detection
- The system queries Attio's API to determine the type of each field before formatting values
- Caches field metadata to minimize API calls
- Falls back to intelligent type inference if API calls fail

### 2. Intelligent Value Formatting
- Different field types are formatted according to Attio's requirements
- Special handling for arrays, wrapped values, and direct values
- Automatic conversion between field name variations (e.g., first_name → name)

### 3. Support for Multiple Field Types

#### Text Fields
- Regular text fields are wrapped with `{value: "text"}`
- Personal name fields (like the "name" field in people) use direct values
- Services field is treated as a string rather than an array

#### Email and Domain Fields
- Email addresses are sent as arrays without value wrapping
- Domain fields follow the same pattern as email addresses
- Both support multiple values in array format

#### URL Fields
- URL fields like website, linkedin, twitter are wrapped with `{value: "url"}`
- Automatic URL validation can be added

#### Phone Number Fields
- Phone numbers are sent as arrays without value wrapping
- Support for multiple phone numbers
- Note: Attio has strict phone number validation requiring proper country codes

#### Select Fields
- Select fields send direct string values (the option title or ID)
- Multi-select fields send arrays of strings
- Option discovery and validation can be implemented

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **attribute-types.ts**
   - `detectFieldType()`: Determines the field type from Attio metadata
   - `formatAttributeValue()`: Formats values according to field type
   - `formatAllAttributes()`: Processes all attributes in an object
   - Handles caching and fallback logic

2. **base-operations.ts**
   - Generic operations that work with any Attio object type
   - Integrates dynamic field detection automatically
   - Provides create, update, and delete operations

3. **Object-specific Files**
   - `people-write.ts`: Write operations for people with dynamic fields
   - `companies.ts`: Updated to use dynamic field detection

### Field Type Mapping

```typescript
// Special field type handling
switch (typeInfo.attioType) {
  case 'text':
    // Most text fields need wrapping except person name
    if (objectSlug === 'people' && attributeSlug === 'name') {
      return value; // Direct value
    }
    return { value }; // Wrapped value
    
  case 'personal-name':
    return value; // Direct value
    
  case 'email-address':
  case 'domain':
  case 'phone-number':
    // Array fields without value wrapping
    const arrayValue = Array.isArray(value) ? value : [value];
    return arrayValue;
    
  // ... other field types
}
```

## Testing Results

### Working Features
- ✅ Person creation with name, email, job title, description
- ✅ Company creation with name, domains, website, services
- ✅ Person and company updates with dynamic fields
- ✅ Multiple email addresses and domains
- ✅ Proper field type detection and formatting
- ✅ Field metadata caching for performance

### Known Limitations
- Phone numbers require specific formatting with valid country codes
- Select fields need valid option values (not dynamically discovered yet)
- Some field types (like currency) may need additional formatting logic

## Benefits

1. **No Hardcoding Required**: The system automatically adapts to custom fields
2. **Future-Proof**: New fields added to Attio are automatically supported
3. **Organization-Specific**: Works with any organization's custom attribute setup
4. **Type Safety**: TypeScript integration ensures type safety throughout
5. **Performance**: Caching reduces API calls for better performance

## Next Steps

1. Implement select option discovery and validation
2. Add phone number format validation and normalization
3. Support for additional field types (currency, location, etc.)
4. Enhanced error handling and validation messages
5. Unit tests for all field type combinations

## Example Usage

```typescript
// Create a person with dynamic fields
const person = await createPerson({
  name: 'John Doe',
  email_addresses: ['john@example.com'],
  job_title: 'Software Engineer',
  linkedin: 'https://linkedin.com/in/johndoe'
});

// Create a company with dynamic fields
const company = await createCompany({
  name: 'Tech Corp',
  domains: ['techcorp.com'],
  website: 'https://techcorp.com',
  services: 'Software Development'
});
```

The system handles all the field type detection and formatting automatically!

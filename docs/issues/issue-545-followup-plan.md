## Issue #545 – E2E Test Stabilization Plan – Progress

Source plan: /private/tmp/issue-545-followup-plan.md

### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
- [x] Add beforeAll guards to failing task blocks
  - Task→Company Linking: added ensureCompany seeding via `TestDataSeeder`
  - Task Deletion Cascade: added ensureTask seeding via `TestDataSeeder`
- [x] Implement TestDataSeeder helper class (`test/e2e/utils/test-data-seeder.ts`)
- [/] Convert assertions per checklist (record-management)
  - No direct ID assertions found; suite already uses `E2EAssertions`. Skipped as N/A.
- [x] Seed notes for pagination in record-management suite
  - Ensures ≥3 notes exist for selected company prior to pagination tests
- [ ] Run diagnostic commands and capture logs
- [ ] Verify Attio API connectivity and rate limits
- [ ] Fix any "No test suite found" issues (none observed)

### Consolidation (Day 2)
- [ ] Sweep all E2E tests for assertion consistency
- [ ] Implement test sequencer configuration (confirm settings in vitest e2e config)
- [ ] Create health check dashboard script
- [ ] Run progressive validation stages

### Finalization (Day 3)
- [ ] Document test data lifecycle in README
- [ ] Add E2E troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update CI pipeline with new test strategy
- [ ] Create PR with comprehensive test results

### Notes
- Added deterministic data seeding without altering production code paths.
- Followed “E2E ≠ Mocks” policy; seeding uses universal/notes/tasks tools.
- Kept changes scoped to tests and utilities.

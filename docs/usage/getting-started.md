### üîë Step 2: Get Your Attio API Credentials (60 seconds)

1. **Go to Attio API Settings**: [app.attio.com/settings/api](https://app.attio.com/settings/api)
2. **Create New API Key**: Click "Generate API Key"
3. **Copy Your Key**: It looks like: `att_1a2b3c4d5e6f...` (64 characters)
4. **Save It Safely**: You'll need this in the next step

### ‚ö° Step 3: One-Command Installation (60 seconds)

**Choose your preferred installation method:**

**Option A: NPM Global Install (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install -g attio-mcp-server
```

**Option B: One-Line Script Install**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kesslerio/attio-mcp-server/main/install.sh | bash
```

```

### üîß Step 4: Configure Claude Desktop (90 seconds)

1. **Find Claude Config File**:
   - **Mac**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. **Add Attio MCP Server** (copy and paste this, replacing YOUR_API_KEY):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "attio-mcp": {
      "command": "attio-mcp-server",
      "env": {
        "ATTIO_API_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
        "ATTIO_DEFAULT_DEAL_OWNER": "user@company.com",
        "ATTIO_DEFAULT_DEAL_STAGE": "Interested",
        "ATTIO_DEFAULT_CURRENCY": "USD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Optional: Configure Deal Defaults**
   
   The additional environment variables shown above configure default values for deal creation:
   - `ATTIO_DEFAULT_DEAL_OWNER`: Email address of the default deal owner (typically your email)
   - `ATTIO_DEFAULT_DEAL_STAGE`: Default stage for new deals (check your Attio workspace for available stages)
   - `ATTIO_DEFAULT_CURRENCY`: Default currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP)

   These are optional but recommended if you plan to create deals via Claude.

4. **Save and Restart Claude Desktop**

---

### üéØ Step 5: Test Your First Query (60 seconds)

**Restart Claude Desktop, then copy and paste this exact prompt:**

```
Test my Attio CRM connection using universal tools:
1. Use search-records with resource_type="companies" to count total companies
2. Use search-records with resource_type="people" to count total contacts  
3. Use search-by-timeframe to find companies added in last 5 days
4. Use get-lists to show available lists and pipelines

Limit each result to 10 items and format as dashboard for setup verification.
```

**Alternative Simple Test:**
```
Show me a CRM overview using universal tools: company count, contact count, and recent activity. Verify my Attio connection is working properly.
```

**üéâ Success!** If you see your CRM data, you're ready to go!

## üö® Quick Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "Attio MCP Server not found"

**Likely cause**: Installation issue or Claude can't find the command

**Quick fixes**:
1. **Reinstall globally**: `npm install -g attio-mcp-server`
2. **Use full path**: Change `"command": "attio-mcp-server"` to `"command": "npx attio-mcp-server"`
3. **Check installation**: Run `attio-mcp-server --help` in terminal

### ‚ùå "Authentication failed"

**Likely cause**: Incorrect API key or formatting

**Quick fixes**:
1. **Check API key**: Ensure it's exactly 64 characters starting with `att_`
2. **No extra spaces**: Remove any spaces before/after the key
3. **Regenerate key**: Create a new API key in Attio settings

### ‚ùå "No data returned" or empty results

**Likely cause**: Empty CRM or permission issues

**Quick fixes**:
1. **Check Attio data**: Log into Attio web app to verify you have data
2. **API permissions**: Ensure your API key has read access to companies/people
3. **Try simple query**: `"Show me anything in my Attio CRM"`

### ‚ùå Claude doesn't recognize the server

**Likely cause**: Configuration or restart issue

**Quick fixes**:
1. **Restart Claude completely**: Quit and reopen Claude Desktop
2. **Check JSON syntax**: Validate your `claude_desktop_config.json` is valid JSON
3. **File location**: Double-check you're editing the correct config file location

Begin with basic data queries, then gradually add filters, automation, and advanced workflows.

The playbooks contain battle-tested prompts that solve real business problems - don't reinvent the wheel.

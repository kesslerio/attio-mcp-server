## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### When Searches Return No Results

**Problem**: "No companies found matching your criteria"

**Solutions to try**:
```
1. Broaden your search:
   "Find all companies in any technology-related industry"

2. Check for typos in company names:
   "Search for companies with names containing 'Acm' or 'Acme'"

3. Use partial matching:
   "Show me companies where the name starts with 'Tech'"
```

### When Deal Information Is Missing

**Universal Tools Solution**:
```
For comprehensive task details:
✅ Use: "Get task details for tasks created in last 7 days, showing content and title fields"

For deals with missing info:
- Use get-detailed-info with resource_type="deals"
- Use search-by-relationship to find linked companies/contacts
- When creating records, always include both 'content' and 'title' fields
```

### Large Dataset Issues

**Problem**: Responses get cut off or truncated (Known Issue #469)

**Pagination Solutions**:
```
❌ Avoid: "Export all companies with full details"
✅ Use: "Show me companies 1-25 with key fields: name, industry, employee count"

For comprehensive data:
1. "Show me the first 20 deals, then I'll ask for the next batch"
2. "Limit to deals over $5,000 to focus on high-value opportunities"
3. "Just show company name, stage, value - skip detailed notes"
```

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Efficiency

### 1. **Use Universal Tools Effectively**
```
✅ Always specify resource_type: "companies", "people", "tasks", "deals"
✅ Use get-attributes first: "Show me available fields for companies"
✅ Build incrementally: Simple query → add filters → refine results
```

### 2. **Optimize for Performance**
```
✅ Limit results: "Show me first 15 companies by revenue"
✅ Use specific filters: Target exact criteria vs broad searches
✅ Batch operations: Process in smaller chunks
```

### 3. **Handle Known Limitations**
```
✅ For tasks: Include both content and title fields
✅ For large datasets: Use pagination ("first 20, then next 20")
✅ For complex searches: Break into multiple simple queries
```

### 4. **Use Specific Date Ranges**
Instead of: "Show me recent deals"  
Try: "Use search-by-timeframe for deals created in last 14 days"

### 5. **Leverage Search Types**
- **search-records**: Basic filtering by resource type
- **advanced-search**: Multiple conditions with AND/OR logic
- **search-by-relationship**: Find connected records
- **search-by-content**: Text-based matching in notes/descriptions
- **search-by-timeframe**: Date-based filtering

### 6. **Request Formatted Output**
Add to any query: "Format as table with specific columns: [list columns]"

### 7. **Use Action-Oriented Language**
Instead of: "What deals do I have?"  
Try: "Use advanced-search to find deals needing follow-up this week"

## 💡 Pro Tips for Operations Excellence

### 1. **Automate the Routine, Optimize the Complex**
Instead of: Manual daily data checks  
Try: "Set up automated daily reports that flag only exceptions needing human attention"

Instead of: Updating records individually  
Try: "Find all related records that should be updated together when this company information changes"

### 3. **Measure Impact, Not Just Activity**
Instead of: "How many records were updated?"  
Try: "What business impact did these data improvements create for our sales and success teams?"

### 4. **Prevent Rather Than Fix**
Instead of: Cleaning up problems  
Try: "What patterns in our data creation process are causing these issues we can prevent?"

### 5. **Scale Your Intelligence**
Add to queries: "Create templates and automation rules so this analysis can run regularly without manual intervention"

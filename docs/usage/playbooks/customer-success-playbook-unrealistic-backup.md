## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Common Issues

### When Customer Data Seems Incomplete

**Problem**: Missing interaction history or incomplete customer profiles

**Solutions to try**:
```
1. Pull comprehensive customer data:
   "Show me all interactions, deals, notes, and tasks for [CUSTOMER_NAME] across all time periods"

2. Check for data in multiple record types:
   "Find all people associated with [COMPANY_NAME] and their individual interaction histories"

3. Look for related activities:
   "Search for any content, notes, or communications mentioning [CUSTOMER_NAME] or [COMPANY_NAME]"
```

### When Health Scores Don't Make Sense

**Problem**: Automated health scores don't match your intuitive assessment

**Custom Health Check**:
```
For [CUSTOMER_NAME], calculate a custom health score considering:
- Last meaningful interaction (not just any contact)
- Support issue resolution satisfaction
- Stakeholder engagement breadth and depth
- Product usage compared to their stated goals
- Competitive threats or expansion discussions

Explain the factors contributing to their health assessment.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for Customer Success Excellence

### 1. **Think Like Your Customer**
Instead of: "Show me our interaction history"  
Try: "From [CUSTOMER]'s perspective, how has our relationship been trending? What would they say about their experience?"

### 2. **Focus on Business Outcomes**
Instead of: "How often do they log in?"  
Try: "Are they achieving the business outcomes that drove their original purchase decision?"

### 3. **Predict Before Problems Arise**
Instead of: "Show me customers with issues"  
Try: "Show me customers exhibiting early warning signs similar to accounts that previously churned"

### 4. **Segment for Personalization**
Instead of: Generic outreach to all customers  
Try: "Group my customers by industry and maturity stage, then suggest personalized success strategies for each segment"

### 5. **Quantify Success Impact**
Add to queries: "Include quantified business impact and ROI metrics where available"

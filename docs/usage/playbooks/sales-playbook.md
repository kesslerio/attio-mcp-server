# Sales Playbook: Pipeline Management & Deal Progression

*Manage your sales pipeline effectively, track deal progression, and maintain organized prospect relationships through systematic CRM workflows.*

> Important: Data Requirements
> - These prompts assume your Attio workspace contains sales data: companies/prospects, deals/opportunities with stage and value, people/contacts, and notes/tasks for activity.
> - Forecast and pipeline prompts require deal records with stages, values, and dates (e.g., created_at/modified_at/close_date).
> - Outreach/activity prompts expect tasks/notes to exist to infer “last activity” and “next steps”. If you haven’t logged activity, you’ll often see “0 found”.
>
> Tip: Seed a single “Demo Sales Co” with one open deal and a couple of tasks/notes to see realistic outputs.

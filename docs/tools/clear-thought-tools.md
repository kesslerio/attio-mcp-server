# Clear Thought MCP Tools Documentation

## Overview

The Clear Thought MCP Server provides advanced reasoning and problem-solving tools that enhance the development process through systematic thinking approaches. These tools are integrated into the Attio MCP Server development workflow to improve code quality, decision-making, and problem analysis.

## Available Tools

### Sequential Thinking Tools

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__sequentialthinking`
**Purpose**: Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through structured thought chains.

**When to Use**:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope isn't initially clear
- Multi-step solutions requiring context maintenance

### Mental Models

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__mentalmodel`
**Purpose**: Apply structured mental models to problem-solving.

**Available Models**:
- **First Principles Thinking**: Break down complex problems to fundamental truths
- **Opportunity Cost Analysis**: Evaluate trade-offs and alternatives
- **Error Propagation Understanding**: Analyze how errors spread through systems
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Systematic explanation to identify issues
- **Pareto Principle**: Focus on high-impact activities
- **Occam's Razor**: Prefer simpler explanations and solutions

### Design Patterns

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__designpattern`
**Purpose**: Apply software design patterns to architecture and implementation.

**Available Patterns**:
- **Modular Architecture**: Organize code into independent modules
- **API Integration Patterns**: Handle external API interactions
- **State Management**: Manage application state effectively
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle async operations
- **Scalability Considerations**: Design for growth
- **Security Best Practices**: Implement secure patterns
- **Agentic Design Patterns**: Design for AI agent interactions

### Programming Paradigms

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__programmingparadigm`
**Purpose**: Apply different programming paradigms to solve problems.

### Debugging Approaches

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__debuggingapproach`
**Purpose**: Systematic debugging methodologies.

**Available Approaches**:
- **Binary Search**: Divide and conquer problem space
- **Reverse Engineering**: Work backward from symptoms
- **Divide and Conquer**: Break problems into smaller parts
- **Backtracking**: Systematic trial and error
- **Cause Elimination**: Systematically eliminate possible causes
- **Program Slicing**: Focus on relevant code sections

### Decision Framework

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__decisionframework`
**Purpose**: Structured decision analysis and rational choice.

### Scientific Method

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__scientificmethod`
**Purpose**: Apply formal scientific reasoning to problems.

### Structured Argumentation

#### `mcp__clear-thought-server__structuredargumentation`
**Purpose**: Systematic dialectical reasoning and argument analysis.

## Integration with Attio MCP Server Development

### Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Problem Analysis**: Use mental models (First Principles, Error Propagation)
2. **Architecture Planning**: Apply design patterns for system design
3. **Implementation Strategy**: Choose appropriate programming paradigms
4. **Debugging**: Use systematic debugging approaches
5. **Documentation/Synthesis**: Use sequential thinking for comprehensive analysis

### Enhanced Testing with Clear Thought

#### Pre-Test Analysis
- Use mental models (Error Propagation) to understand failure modes
- Apply scientific method for test hypothesis formation

#### Test Strategy
- Use debugging approaches (Program Slicing) for focused testing
- Apply decision framework for test prioritization

#### Failure Analysis
- Use sequential thinking for systematic failure investigation
- Apply debugging approaches for root cause analysis

## Examples in Practice

### Test Cleanup Strategy (Issue #319)

**Tools Used**:
- Sequential thinking for comprehensive analysis
- Mental models (First Principles) for understanding test purpose
- Decision framework for test retention/removal decisions

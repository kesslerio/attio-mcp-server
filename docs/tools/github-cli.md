# GitHub CLI Documentation

The GitHub CLI documentation has been reorganized into a modular structure for better maintainability and readability.

Please refer to the following modules:

1. [Overview, Installation & Authentication](/github-cli/README.md)
2. [Working with Issues and Labels](/github-cli/issues.md)
3. [Projects and Milestones](/github-cli/projects.md)
4. [Pull Request Management](/github-cli/pull-requests.md)
5. [Workflows and Best Practices](/github-cli/workflows.md)

This modular approach addresses the maintainability concerns by splitting the previously monolithic documentation into logical modules focused on specific areas of GitHub CLI functionality.

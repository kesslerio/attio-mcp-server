# Refactoring Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for refactoring code in the attio-mcp-server project.

## General Principles

- **Follow Existing Conventions**: Adhere to the existing code style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
- **Tests First**: Before refactoring, ensure adequate test coverage exists. If not, write tests first.
- **Small, Incremental Changes**: Prefer small, atomic commits over large, sweeping changes.
- **Leave it Better Than You Found It**: The "Boy Scout Rule."

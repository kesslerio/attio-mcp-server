# Daily Changelog Workflow

## Overview

The daily changelog workflow automatically generates changelog entries by analyzing git commits from the last 24 hours. It runs at 8 PM PT daily and can also be triggered manually.

## Improvements Made

### Key Issues Resolved

1. **Permission Errors**: Fixed Claude Code action permission issues by:
   - Adding explicit `token: ${{ github.token }}` to checkout step
   - Configuring git user properly for automated commits
   - Adding environment checks to validate permissions

2. **Reliability**: Added robust fallback mechanism that:
   - Uses traditional GitHub Actions if Claude Code action fails
   - Provides consistent output regardless of which method succeeds
   - Includes comprehensive error handling

3. **Observability**: Added debugging and monitoring features:
   - Environment validation checks
   - Detailed logging at each step
   - Summary report with success/failure status
   - Links to created PRs for easy access

    D --> E{Success?}

    H --> I[Generate Changelog]
    I --> J[Commit & PR]
    J --> F
    F --> K[Complete]
```

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Environment Setup

- Checkout repository with full git history
- Configure git user as `github-actions[bot]`
- Validate tools and permissions

### 2. Primary Method (Claude Code Action)

- Analyze commits using AI
- Categorize changes intelligently
- Create well-formatted changelog entries
- Handle edge cases and complex commit patterns

### 3. Fallback Method (Traditional Actions)

- Parse commits using regex patterns
- Categorize into Added/Fixed/Changed sections
- Generate basic but functional changelog entries
- Ensure workflow never fails completely

### 4. Output Generation

- Create branch: `chore/daily-changelog-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` after `## [Unreleased]` section
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Create pull request automatically

## Manual Testing

Use the provided test script to debug locally:

```bash
./scripts/test-changelog.sh
```

This script:

- Shows what commits would be included
- Generates preview of changelog content
- Allows testing branch creation and PR workflow
- Provides cleanup instructions

## Configuration

### Schedule

```yaml
schedule:
  - cron: '0 4 * * *' # 8 PM PT daily (4 AM UTC next day)
```

### Manual Trigger

Go to Actions ‚Üí Daily Changelog ‚Üí Run workflow

### Required Permissions

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write # Create branches, commit files
  pull-requests: write # Create PRs
  id-token: write # GitHub authentication
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No Meaningful Changes**
   - Workflow will output: "No meaningful changes since yesterday"
   - This is expected behavior, not an error

2. **Permission Denied**
   - Check if `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret is configured
   - Verify token has repository write permissions
   - Fallback method should still work

3. **Claude Code Action Timeout**
   - Fallback method will activate automatically
   - Check logs for "using fallback method" message

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Environment**:

   ```bash
   # In workflow logs, look for "Environment Check" section
   git status
   gh auth status
   git log --since="1 day ago" --oneline
   ```

2. **Test Locally**:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-changelog.sh
   ```

3. **Manual Workflow**:
   ```bash
   # Create changelog manually if needed
   git checkout -b chore/daily-changelog-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
   # Edit CHANGELOG.md
   git add CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "chore: Daily changelog for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   git push -u origin HEAD
   gh pr create --title "chore: Daily changelog for $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ```

## Changelog Format

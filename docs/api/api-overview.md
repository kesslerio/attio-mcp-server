# Attio API Overview

Attio provides a powerful REST API that allows developers to build applications that read and write information to and from Attio workspaces. The API exchanges JSON over HTTPS and provides comprehensive access to Attio's core functionality.

## Understanding the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Attio MCP server acts as a bridge between Claude (or other AI assistants) and the Attio API. This integration allows Claude to interact with your CRM data without requiring you to manually copy and paste information.

### How MCP Works

1. **Request Flow**: When you ask Claude about Attio data, Claude sends a structured request to the Attio MCP server
2. **Authentication**: The MCP server authenticates with Attio using your API key
3. **Data Retrieval**: The server fetches the requested data from Attio's API
4. **Response**: Claude receives the data and presents it to you in a conversational format

### URI Scheme

The Attio MCP server uses a custom URI scheme to identify resources:

- Companies: `attio://companies/{company_id}`
- People: `attio://people/{person_id}`
- Lists: `attio://lists/{list_id}`
- Notes: `attio://notes/{note_id}`

Claude uses these URIs to reference specific records when performing operations.

### Available Tools

Claude can interact with Attio using various tools provided by the MCP server:

- **Search tools**: Find companies, people, and other records
- **Read tools**: View details of specific records
- **Write tools**: Create notes and update records
- **List management tools**: Work with Attio lists

See the specific API documentation for details on each tool.

## Authentication

### API Keys

For personal or internal use, you can use API keys to authenticate:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key_here
```

### OAuth 2.0

For multi-workspace applications, Attio supports OAuth 2.0:

- **Authorization Endpoint**: `https://auth.attio.com/oauth/authorize`
- **Token Endpoint**: `https://auth.attio.com/oauth/token`

Required scopes vary by endpoint and are documented in the reference documentation.

## Core Concepts

### Objects and Lists

Attio's data model is built around Objects (like Companies, People) and Lists that organize records.

- Objects define the structure of your data (schema)
- Lists provide views and organization of records
- Records are instances of objects with specific attribute values

### Standard Objects

Attio includes several standard objects:

- Companies
- People
- Opportunities
- Tasks
- Notes
- Workspaces
- Users

### API Endpoints

The API is organized into functional areas:

- **Objects**: Create, read, update, delete objects and their attributes
- **Lists**: Manage lists and list entries
- **Records**: Create, read, update, delete records
- **People**: Manage person records
- **Tasks**: Manage tasks and assignments
- **Notes**: Create and manage notes attached to records
- **Users**: Manage workspace users and permissions
- **Webhooks**: Subscribe to real-time events

## Base URL

All API requests should be directed to:

```
https://api.attio.com/v2/
```

## Rate Limits

The Attio API imposes rate limits to ensure stability. Current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 1,000 requests per hour per API key

## Response Format

All responses are in JSON format. A typical successful response includes:

```json
{
  "data": {},
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "pageSize": 25,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

Error responses include a status code, error type, and error message:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "The requested resource was not found"
  }
}
```

Common error status codes:
- 400: Bad Request
- 401: Unauthorized
- 403: Forbidden
- 404: Not Found
- 429: Too Many Requests
- 500: Internal Server Error

## Pagination

API endpoints that return lists of items support pagination with the following parameters:

- `page`: The page number to retrieve (starting at 1)
- `pageSize`: The number of items per page (default 25, max 100)

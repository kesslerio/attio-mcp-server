Please generate documentation for the module/file specified in $ARGUMENTS.

Follow these steps:

1.  **Identify Target:** Locate the file path provided in the arguments (e.g., `src/core/utils/domain_utils.py`).
2.  **Analyze Code:** Read and understand the purpose, classes, functions, and overall logic within the file.
3.  **Generate Module Docstring:** Write a concise and informative docstring for the top of the module explaining its purpose and key exports.
4.  **Generate Class/Function Docstrings:** For each public class and function:
    *   Write a clear docstring explaining its purpose.
    *   Use Google-style docstrings (Args:, Returns:, Raises:).
    *   Document parameters and return values with types.
    *   Include simple usage examples (`>>>`) where appropriate, ensuring they reflect actual project usage.
5.  **(Optional) Create/Update README Section:** If applicable, draft a section for a relevant README file (e.g., in `/docs/` or a component's `README.md`) summarizing the module's functionality and usage.
6.  **Format Code:** Ensure all generated docstrings are correctly formatted.
7.  **Output:** Provide the complete code for the file with all generated docstrings included. If a README section was drafted, provide that separately.

# List Filtering Enhancement PR Summary

## Changes Made

This PR enhances the list filtering capabilities by adding more flexible and powerful filtering options. The key changes include:

### 1. Enhanced Filter Types in `attio.ts`
- Added a proper `FilterConditionType` enum in `src/types/attio.ts` to standardize filter conditions
- Added type guard function `isValidFilterCondition` to validate filter conditions

### 2. Centralized Filter Transformation
- Created `transformFiltersToApiFormat` utility function in `src/utils/record-utils.ts`
- Added proper error handling with `FilterValidationError` class
- Consolidated filter transformation logic that was previously duplicated

### 3. Advanced Filtering Support
- Enhanced `ListEntryFilter` and `ListEntryFilters` interfaces to support:
  - Multiple filter conditions
  - Logical operators (AND/OR) between filter conditions
  - Filter groups for more complex querying capabilities
- Implemented proper translation to Attio API filter format

### 4. Consistent Filter Handling
- Updated `tryMultipleListEntryEndpoints` in `src/objects/lists.ts` to use the shared utility function
- Ensured all relevant functions accept the enhanced filter parameters

### 5. New MCP Tool
- Added `advanced-filter-list-entries` tool for complex filtering
- Provided full schema documentation for advanced filter usage 
- Updated tool handler in `tools.ts` to process advanced filters

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Enhanced documentation in `docs/api/lists-api.md` with examples of advanced filtering
- Added code examples for using the advanced filtering capabilities
- Documented each filter condition type with clear descriptions

### 7. Testing
- Created filter transformation tests to validate filter conversion
- Ensured type safety across all changes

## Benefits

This enhancement provides several key benefits:

1. **More Powerful Querying**: Users can now create complex filters combining multiple conditions with both AND and OR logic
2. **Consistent Implementation**: Centralized filter handling improves maintainability and reduces duplication
3. **Type Safety**: Enhanced typing ensures better validation and developer experience
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear examples help users understand and utilize the new capabilities

## Example Usage

```javascript
// Using the advanced filter tool
const advancedFilters = {
  filters: [
    {
      attribute: {
        slug: "industry"
      },
      condition: "equals",
      value: "Technology",
      logicalOperator: "or" // This filter is combined with the next using OR
    },
    {
      attribute: {
        slug: "annual_revenue"
      },
      condition: "greater_than",
      value: 10000000
    }
  ],
  matchAny: true // When true, ANY of the filters must match (equivalent to OR)
};

// Usage with MCP
advanced-filter-list-entries({
  listId: "list_01defghijklmnopqrstuvwxy",
  filters: advancedFilters,
  limit: 50
})
```

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements could include:
- Support for nested filter groups for even more complex queries
- Add a count API to get the number of matching entries without retrieving them
- Add support for additional filter types as Attio API evolves

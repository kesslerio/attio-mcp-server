# PR #389 Fix: Preventing API Calls in Error Paths

## Issue Description
**Location**: `src/handlers/tool-configs/universal/field-mapper.ts:505` (actually in `shared-handlers.ts`)
**Problem**: An API call was being made during error handling, which could cause cascading failures during high error rates.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the deal creation error handling path where `applyDealDefaultsWithValidation` was being called, which internally calls:
1. `validateDealStage()` 
2. `getAvailableDealStages()` 
3. Makes API call to `/objects/deals/attributes`

When a deal creation fails (e.g., invalid stage), the error handler tries to apply defaults and validate the stage again, making another API call. During high error rates, this could overwhelm the API and cause cascading failures.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `skipValidation` Parameter
Modified `applyDealDefaultsWithValidation` to accept a `skipValidation` parameter:
```typescript
export async function applyDealDefaultsWithValidation(
  recordData: Record<string, any>,
  skipValidation: boolean = false  // New parameter
): Promise<Record<string, any>>
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Path Handling
In `shared-handlers.ts`, the error recovery path now skips validation:
```typescript
// In error catch block
dealData = await applyDealDefaultsWithValidation(
  { ...record_data, stage: defaults.stage },
  true // Skip validation in error path
);
```

### 3. Improved Caching Strategy
Added error caching to prevent repeated failed API calls:
- Cache successful responses for 5 minutes
- Cache errors for 30 seconds to prevent rapid retries
- Check error cache before making API calls

### 4. Additional Safety Measures
- `validateDealStage` now accepts `skipApiCall` parameter
- Error cache prevents cascading failures during API outages
- Helper functions `clearDealCaches()` and `prewarmStageCache()` for cache management

## Files Modified

1. **src/config/deal-defaults.ts**
   - Added `skipValidation` parameter to `applyDealDefaultsWithValidation`
   - Added `skipApiCall` parameter to `validateDealStage`
   - Implemented error caching mechanism
   - Added cache management utilities

2. **src/handlers/tool-configs/universal/shared-handlers.ts**
   - Updated deal creation error handler to skip validation
   - Pass `skipValidation=true` in error recovery path
   - Added comments explaining the performance implications

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite in `test/config/deal-defaults.test.ts` that verifies:
- API calls are skipped when `skipValidation=true`
- Normal path still makes API calls for validation
- Error caching prevents cascading failures
- Cache management functions work correctly

## Impact

This fix prevents potential cascading failures in production by:
1. **Avoiding unnecessary API calls** during error recovery
2. **Implementing smart caching** to reduce API load
3. **Providing graceful degradation** during API failures

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced API calls**: No validation API calls in error paths
- **Faster error recovery**: Skip validation speeds up error handling
- **Better resilience**: Error caching prevents rapid retry storms
- **Lower latency**: Cached responses improve normal path performance

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are fully backward compatible:
- Default behavior unchanged (validation still happens by default)
- Existing code continues to work without modifications
- New parameters are optional with sensible defaults

## Deployment Notes

No configuration changes required. The fix will take effect immediately upon deployment and will:
- Reduce API load during error scenarios
- Improve system stability during high error rates
- Provide better performance through caching

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:
1. Monitor API call rates during error scenarios
2. Check that error recovery doesn't trigger validation API calls
3. Verify cache is being utilized (check logs for cache hits)
4. Ensure normal operations still validate stages properly

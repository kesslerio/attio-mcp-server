# Issue #257: Phase 2 - Complete Dispatcher Modularization Refactoring

Please help me implement GitHub issue #257 "Phase 2: Complete dispatcher modularization refactoring".

## Issue Summary
Complete the dispatcher refactoring by extracting remaining operation modules from the legacy implementation. Phase 1 successfully reduced the main dispatcher from 2,200+ to 108 lines while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.

## Your Current Context
You are working in the git worktree at `/Users/kesslerio/GDrive/Projects/attio-mcp-server-issue-257` on branch `refactor/dispatcher-modularization-phase2-257`.

**IMPORTANT:** All git commands must be run from this worktree directory and target the `refactor/dispatcher-modularization-phase2-257` branch, NOT `main`.

## Phase 2 Scope
Extract the following operation modules:

### Operation Modules to Create
- [ ] **operations/companies.ts** - Company-specific operations (create, update, delete, batch operations)
- [ ] **operations/records.ts** - Generic record operations (CRUD, batch operations)  
- [ ] **operations/lists.ts** - List management operations (get lists, entries, filtering)
- [ ] **operations/notes.ts** - Note operations (get, create for companies/people)
- [ ] **operations/relationships.ts** - Relationship-based search operations
- [ ] **operations/advanced-search.ts** - Advanced search with complex filtering

## Implementation Plan

Please follow these steps:

1. **Analyze current state**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/kesslerio/GDrive/Projects/attio-mcp-server-issue-257
   gh issue view 257
   ```

2. **Review Phase 1 patterns**:
   - Examine `src/handlers/tools/dispatcher/operations/search.ts` (Phase 1 example)
   - Study the modular patterns established in PR #254
   - Review how utilities were extracted (logging, validation, formatting)

3. **Create operation modules**:
   - Follow the established pattern from Phase 1
   - Extract each operation type into focused modules
   - Maintain consistent error handling patterns
   - Use proper TypeScript types throughout

4. **Implementation Guidelines**:
   - **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one operation type
   - **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain all existing functionality through re-exports
   - **Error Handling**: Use consistent patterns from Phase 1
   - **TypeScript**: Strict typing with proper interfaces
   - **Testing**: Preserve all existing test coverage

5. **Extraction Process**:
   For each module:
   - Identify operations in the main dispatcher
   - Extract to new module file
   - Add proper imports/exports
   - Update main dispatcher to use new module
   - Test for regressions

6. **Build and test**:
   ```bash
   # Verify TypeScript compilation
   npm run build
   
   # Run tests to ensure no regressions  
   npm test
   
   # Check type checking
   npm run check
   ```

7. **Commit systematically**:
   ```bash
   # Verify branch
   git branch --show-current  # Should show: refactor/dispatcher-modularization-phase2-257
   
   # Commit each module extraction separately
   git add src/handlers/tools/dispatcher/operations/companies.ts
   git commit -m "Refactor: extract companies operations module (#257)"
   
   git add src/handlers/tools/dispatcher/operations/records.ts  
   git commit -m "Refactor: extract records operations module (#257)"
   
   # Continue for each module...
   
   # Final commit updating main dispatcher
   git add src/handlers/tools/dispatcher/core.ts
   git commit -m "Refactor: update core dispatcher to use extracted operation modules (#257)"
   
   # Push all commits
   git push origin refactor/dispatcher-modularization-phase2-257
   ```

8. **Create PR**:
   ```bash
   # Update issue status
   gh issue edit 257 --add-label "status:in-progress"
   
   # Create comprehensive PR
   echo "# Refactor: Complete dispatcher modularization refactoring (Phase 2)

   Fixes #257

   ## Summary
   Completes the dispatcher modularization by extracting remaining operation modules, building on Phase 1's success.

   ## Changes
   - ✅ **operations/companies.ts** - Company-specific operations extracted
   - ✅ **operations/records.ts** - Generic record CRUD operations extracted  
   - ✅ **operations/lists.ts** - List management operations extracted
   - ✅ **operations/notes.ts** - Note operations extracted
   - ✅ **operations/relationships.ts** - Relationship search operations extracted
   - ✅ **operations/advanced-search.ts** - Complex filtering operations extracted

   ## Architecture Benefits
   - **Modularity**: Each operation type in focused module
   - **Maintainability**: Easier to locate and modify specific operations
   - **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently  
   - **Scalability**: New operations can be added to appropriate modules
   - **Consistency**: All modules follow established Phase 1 patterns

   ## Backward Compatibility
   - ✅ All existing functionality preserved
   - ✅ No breaking changes to public APIs
   - ✅ All tests continue to pass
   - ✅ Tool registration unchanged

   ## Testing
   - ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
   - ✅ All existing tests pass
   - ✅ No regressions detected
   - ✅ Module isolation verified" > /tmp/pr-body-257.md
   
   gh pr create --base main --head refactor/dispatcher-modularization-phase2-257 --title "Refactor: complete dispatcher modularization refactoring (Phase 2) (#257)" --body-file /tmp/pr-body-257.md
   ```

## Key Focus Areas
- **Modularity**: Each operation type in its own focused module
- **Consistency**: Follow Phase 1 patterns exactly
- **Backward Compatibility**: Zero breaking changes
- **Error Handling**: Maintain existing error patterns
- **Testing**: Ensure no regressions

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 6 operation modules extracted and implemented
- [ ] Core dispatcher becomes pure orchestration layer
- [ ] 100% backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] PR ready for review

This refactoring will significantly improve code organization and maintainability while preserving all existing functionality.

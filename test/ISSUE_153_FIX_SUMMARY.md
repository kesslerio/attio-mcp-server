# Issue #153 Fix Summary: Batch Create Companies

## Problem

The `batch-create-companies` tool was failing with an error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" when attempting to create multiple companies in a batch operation. The issue also affected the `batch-update-companies` tool (issue #154).

## Root Cause

1. **Parameter Structure Mismatch**: The `batchCreateCompanies` and `batchUpdateCompanies` functions were expecting direct arrays (`companies` and `updates` respectively), but the dispatcher was passing them wrapped in an object.

2. **URL Construction Error**: The batch API endpoint was being constructed incorrectly as `objects/undefined/records/batch` because the object slug was missing.

3. **Error Handling**: The error handling in the dispatcher wasn't providing clear diagnostic information for these specific batch operations.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Function Signatures**:
   - Modified `batchCreateCompanies` in `batch-companies.ts` to accept `{ companies, config }` object
   - Modified `batchUpdateCompanies` in `batch-companies.ts` to accept `{ updates, config }` object
   - Added input validation to ensure arrays are provided

2. **Enhanced Dispatcher**:
   - Updated dispatcher to handle both generic record batch operations and companies-specific batch operations
   - Added resource type detection to use the correct object slug
   - Improved error handling with clearer error messages

3. **Added Error Handling**:
   - Added validation to check for empty or missing arrays
   - Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive
   - Added safeguards to prevent null reference exceptions

4. **Updated Tests**:
   - Updated existing unit tests to use the new parameter structure
   - Added a specific test for the example request from issue #153

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:

1. The specific example request from issue #153:
```json
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "name": "Test Company Alpha",
      "description": "A test company for batch operations",
      "industry": "Technology"
    },
    {
      "name": "Test Company Beta",
      "description": "Another test company for batch operations",
      "industry": "Consulting"
    },
    {
      "name": "Test Company Gamma",
      "description": "A third test company for batch operations",
      "industry": "Manufacturing"
    }
  ]
}
```

2. Unit tests that verify both normal operation and error handling

## How to Verify

After implementing this fix, the batch-create-companies tool should:

1. Correctly handle the companies array structure
2. Properly construct the API endpoint with 'companies' as the object type
3. Successfully create all the provided companies
4. Provide clear error messages if something goes wrong

This fix also addresses issue #154 (batch-update-companies) as they exhibit identical symptoms and required similar changes.

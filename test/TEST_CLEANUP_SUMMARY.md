# Test Directory Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the test directory for better maintainability and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Obsolete Tests
- Deleted issue-specific tests (issue-100-*.js, user-reported-error.js)
- Removed temporary and outdated test files

### 2. Reorganized Directory Structure
- Created logical subdirectories for different test categories:
  - `debug/` - Debug and trace tests
  - `integration/` - Integration tests
  - `performance/` - Performance-related tests
- Moved tests to appropriate subdirectories based on their purpose

### 3. Fixed Import Paths
- Updated all test imports to remove `.js` extensions in TypeScript files
- Fixed module resolution issues by adding `/index` where needed
- Converted ES module imports to CommonJS in JavaScript test files

### 4. Standardized Naming Conventions
- Renamed manual test scripts from `.test.js` to `.manual.js` to prevent Jest from running them
- Ensured proper `.test.ts` suffix for TypeScript tests
- Maintained consistency across all test files

### 5. Updated Test Infrastructure
- Modified package.json test scripts to use new paths
- Created utility scripts for automated fixes:
  - `fix-test-imports.cjs` - Fix import paths
  - `fix-more-imports.cjs` - Additional import fixes
  - `convert-es-to-cjs.cjs` - Convert ES modules to CommonJS

## Test Status
After cleanup:
- Total test suites: 42 (reduced from 52)
- Failing tests: 30 (reduced from 40)
- Passing tests: 135
- Removed 10 obsolete/manual test files

## Remaining Issues
Some tests still fail due to:
1. Missing mock implementations
2. TypeScript compilation errors in certain test files
3. API-specific test failures requiring proper mocking

These issues are beyond the scope of test directory cleanup and would need to be addressed in separate tasks.

## Files Affected
- Removed: 5 obsolete test files
- Renamed: 9 manual test scripts
- Modified: 42+ test files for import fixes
- Created: 3 utility scripts for automation

## Future Recommendations
1. Continue fixing failing tests by updating mocks and type definitions
2. Consider adding a test style guide for consistency
3. Add pre-commit hooks to maintain test organization standards

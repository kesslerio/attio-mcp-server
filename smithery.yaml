# Configuration for Smithery deployment
#
# ATTIO_MCP_TOOL_MODE: Controls which tools are exposed to ChatGPT
#   - "full" (default): All 33 universal tools (requires ChatGPT Developer Mode or ChatGPT Pro+)
#   - "search": Only search, fetch, and health-check tools (for non-Developer Mode users)
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Choose based on your ChatGPT plan
#   ✅ ChatGPT Pro/Team/Enterprise/Edu with Developer Mode enabled: Use "full"
#   ⚠️ ChatGPT without Developer Mode: Use "search" (ChatGPT silently ignores non-search tools)
#
# See docs/chatgpt-developer-mode.md for detailed tool mode explanation
